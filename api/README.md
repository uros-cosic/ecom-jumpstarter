***Important:*** create .env.test file for the testing with test database

## Getting started

First install dependencies using:

```bash
npm i
```

Next run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally read swagger while in development at ```/docs``` and you can start editing code to your liking

**TODO:**

- [ ] Fix redundency
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for all routes
