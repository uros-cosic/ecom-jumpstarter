***Important:*** create .env.test file for the testing with test database

## Getting started

First install dependencies using:

```bash
npm i
```

Next run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally read swagger while in development at ```/docs``` and you can start editing code to your liking

**TODO:**

- [x] Admin routes
- [ ] Admin tests
- [ ] Fix redundency
- [ ] More in depth tests
- [ ] Switch file server to AWS?
- [x] Create swagger docs
- [ ] Finish documentation, add nullable types, parameters and query
- [ ] Dockerize the project (app, redis, mongodb)
